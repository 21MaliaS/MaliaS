                The shockwave from a supernova caused the cloud of interstellar dust to collapse 
            and form a solar nebula. When the cloud collapsed it formed protostars, which is 
            just a star in its early stages of development. When fusion began, the stellar blasts 
            created a wind that caused the cloud to stop pulling matter into it, allowing it to 
            stabilize and no longer collapse in on itself. Using the Core Accretion model to explain 
            this, once the cloud collapsed, the material began to spin, which casued the gravity to 
            strenghten and heat up the center of the disk (the sun). 
                Eventually, at the center of the disk, where it was hotest,the hydrogen atoms began to combine
            and create helium. As the young sun formed and began to heat the disk it was created in, the
            gas within it began to evaporate, leaving the forming planets less time to absorb it, which 
            prevented them from becoming stars. What additionally prevented the early planets from becoming 
            stars was that the sun consumed more than 99% of the original matter within the disk. The other
            clumps of matter that eventually did become planets did not have enough mass for a gravitational 
            collapse to occur and start nuclear fusion. 
                Additionally, because of physics and something in particular, called angular momentum, the earth 
            will not collide with the sun. Since the earth has its own motion and speed it orbits the sun with, 
            the speed it goes around the sun would need to change in order for the sun's huge mass and 
            gravitational pull to make the earth collide with the sun.
