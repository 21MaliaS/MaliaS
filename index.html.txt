            Currently, there are three main explanations for the formation of the solar system. The Accretion model, The Disk Instability model, 
        and the Pebble Accretion model. The Accretion model argues that the solar nebula collapsed on itself because of a shockwave from a 
        supernova. Gravity began to make to make the material spin and form a disk. It also argues that the other matter that did not become 
        the sun, came together in small bits and formed planetesimals (bodies that did become or could've become planets). It also credits 
        solar wind and gravity for a lot of the organization, and make up of the planets. 
        <br>
            The Disk Instability model argues that dust particles were stuck together before the cloud formed a disk. It continues to say that the 
        small dust clumps eventually formed large planets. The Disk Instability model also argues that the planets stabilized and created orbits 
        very early, in order to not collide with the sun. This model is relatively newer, and scientists are collecting more evidence in attempt 
        to prove it. 
        <br>
            The Pebble Accretion model is very similar to the Disk Instability model. It argues that small pebble clumps formed and began to stick
        together and that in order for some planets to obtain more mass, the already bigger pebble clumps would steal from the smaller clumps. 
        This model is also relatively new.
        <br>
        For the purpose of this project, I used the Accretion model to explain the formation of the solar system.

            <p class="index_p">Our solar system was formed by a cloud made of interstellar dust and other materials. It is believed that the dust came from the remnants of a 
                solar system that existed before our current one.

            <p class="index_p">The sun was created from the hydrogen atoms fusing together at the center
                of the cloud of interstellar dust. Most of the matter in the cloud became part of the sun.

            <p class="index_p">The planets formed from the remaining matter in the cloud that did not get pulled into the sun.
            The planets today, also have different atmospheres because of their position in the interstellar dust cloud.
