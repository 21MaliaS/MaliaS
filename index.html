    Hi! My name is Malia Sardinha and I'm in the 11th grade at LREI. I have a cat named Dexter, who I love very much, but he doesn't seem to feel the same way about me.
    In school, I particpate in the Black Student Union, the Asian Affinity group, aswell as lead co lead the Feminism group and the Student of Color group. Outside of 
    school I dance hula with my mom on Sundays. Although I have not been since the second to last week in October, under usual circumstances, I go every sunday. Dancing 
    hula has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the connection between imperialism, resistance, culture, celebration, and lamguage. Aside from Hula, I used 
    to do basketball, but after a few practises a realized that I no longer like to play sports. Add more words Add more words Add more words Add more words Add more words. 
    my web design class I learned how to code this webpage, as well as a lot of other pages. My favorite other webpage I coded is <a href="https://codehs.com/student/1315626/section/99935/assignment/5572911/"
