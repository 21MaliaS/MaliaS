    <p class="align">
    My name is <b>Malia Sardinha</b>, I am 16 and an 11th-grade student at LREI. I have a cat named Dexter, whom I love very much. He's going to be a year old in 3 months. At LREI, 
    I participate in the x-block's Black Student Union and the Asian Affinity group. I am a co-leader the Feminism x-block and the Student of Color x-block. Outside of school, 
    I dance Hula with my mom on Sundays. We don't always go every Sunday, but my mom always tries to go. Dancing hula has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the 
    connection between imperialism, resistance, culture, celebration, and language. Aside from Hula, I used to do basketball, but I was not able to go that much because of my 
    schedule. This November, I did crew for the LREI highschool for the first time. Doing crew for <i>The Crucible</i> was really fun and I learned a lot. I am designing this web site 
    for my web design class. I've learned a lot about how people interact with web pages and the internet, which is something I had never thought about before. This class I 
    learned how to code this webpage, as well as a lot of other pages. My favorite webpage I coded, other than this one, is my <a href="https://codehs.com/student/1315626/section/99935/assignment/5572911/"
