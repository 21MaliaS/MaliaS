                As said before, most of the matter in the interstellar cloud became the sun. But other parts within the disk
            began to clump together. Those clumps formed into planets, dwarf planets, and moons.<br>
            The reason why there are terrestrial and gaseous planets in the solar system is because of solar wind. 
            In the inner solar system, the solar winds were more intense and blew away lighter elements like helium and hydrogen, 
            heavier matter which would form solid ground. 
                In the outer solar sytem the solar winds were weaker and did not blow all the lighter elements away. 
            This also has to do with which planets have their original atmospheres. All of thr planets orginally 
            started off with atmospeheres consisting of Helium and Hydrogen. The planets in the inner solr system, (Mercury, Venus, 
            Mars, and Earth) no longer have their original atmospheres. As I said before, solar winds were impacted the inner solar 
            system more, which blew away lighter elements, including the atmospheres. The gases that make up the atmospheres for those 
            planets now, come from the interior. 
            The planets in the outer solar sytem, (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) maintained their original atmospheres. These four planets
            have thick atmospheres, with small solid cores in proportion, while the other four have thinner atmospheres, with large solid matter 
            in the interior. 
                In addition to solar winds, the gravity at the center of the disk was stronger and attracted heavier matter, while the gravity
            farther out in the disk was weaker, meaning the planets in the other solar sytem did not condense with as heavy materials, as the planets 
            closer to the sun did.
